Ghoul Website (As I don't know what to do with it, I throw it here, for those who want it.)
---
- This is the old GhoulPvP website. The code is messy, and the style is a mix of random stuff. It uses a poorly implemented REST API — overall, just a mess.

- The style isn't entirely mine; it's a mix of different styles, borrowed designs, and so on, haha.

- This is the Cave website converted to plain HTML, CSS, and JS to avoid using heavy frameworks and make it faster — and well, this is what came out.
